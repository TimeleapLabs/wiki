Safety tips
===========

Don't trust anyone
------------------

Do not trust anyone, and by "anyone" we mean exactly that. People on the internet
might not be the one they're claiming to be. It is easy to impersonate another person
on the internet. You should never share sensitive information with anyone online, this
includes but is not limited to your name, date of birth, address, passwords, seed phrase
and private keys.

We never DM you first
---------------------

Kenshi team members never start a conversation or send you a private message first. Stay cautious.
There have been cases of hackers impersonating the Kenshi team members, even if the project
owner sends you a message and asks you to open a link or share your seed phrase with them.
In such cases you must block them, report them, and delete the conversation. Additionally, you can
inform the community of the incident.

Official website and community
------------------------------

Kenshi has one and only one website and domain. All kenshi pages are on the `kenshi.io` domain.
Make sure you're always on the `https://` protocol. Kenshi doesn't have any other communities except
the ones listed on our website_, and on our documentation_ page.

Security
-----------------------

Keep a backup of your seed phrase somewhere safe. Your tokens are not stored on your computer or
in your wallet, they're stored on the blockchain. Your seed phrase, or private keys are needed to
interact with the blockchain, and to prove you are the owner of these tokens. If in any case you
lose access to your phone or computer you can use this seed phrase to recover your funds. Make sure
you are the only one with access to your seed phrase. Consider using a hardware wallet so that your
signing key can be kept securely separate from your internet connected devices.
