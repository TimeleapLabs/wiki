What is Kenshi?
===============

Kenshi is a tech company interested in the blockchain technology and
distributed systems, as well as a token on the BNB Chain.
While the vast majority of tokens on the market rely merely on the
market hype to derive their value, Kenshi does it by bringing actual
projects into life.

Kenshi as a Tech Company
------------------------

On the tech side, Kenshi engineers and implements multiple projects,
mainly blockchain related such as exchanges and oracles. Kenshi markets
these projects and shares a portion of the profits back to the holders
of the Kenshi token. This brings value to the community, pushing the
price of the token up.

Kenshi as a Token
-----------------

The Kenshi token gives everyone a convenient way of investing on Kenshi
projects and getting a passive income in return. A small part of each 
transaction is invested on the Kenshi projects, returning back profits
to all of the holders.
